                "description": "If there’s something in São Paulo is beauty, and this is one of those places that shines with it. The São Bento Monastery is one of the finest colonial churches in Brazil, it was built back in 1641 and its location, on top of the Morro de São Bento makes it the perfect spot to enjoy the views of the city. \n\nIts facade can be quite simple but its interior is an incredible baroque styled one, richly decorated in gold. Inside you can find historical treasures such as wood carvings designed by Frei Domingos da Conceição and paintings by José de Oliveira Rosa. \n\nIf you visit on Sundays the High mass starts at 10 am and it includes a choir of Benedictine monks singing Georgorian chants. It is a great experience.\n\nFor more information on schedules and prices, consult its official website.",

The favela is located on the hill of Doña Marta and has become an important tourist attraction in the city. The hill is located in between the neighborhoods of Botafogo and Laranjeiras.\r\n\r\nThe location of the favela offers one of the most beautiful views of Rio de Janeiro, which is favored by the slope of the area. The figure of Christ the Redeemer is visible from Santa Marta, making it the ideal place to take panoramic photos. The favela has a great history as it has been one of the most marginal neighborhoods in the city.\r\n\r\nGreat figures have visited Santa Marta favela. In 1996, it was the setting for the music video for Michael Jackson's famous song “They don't care about us”. Thus, after his death, residents placed a statue in his honor.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the colorful façades of the place and take a ride on the cable car. Visiting this favela is safe for tourists, and it is a great option to get to know the most humble face of Brazil.",

While the island exudes a charming sense of tranquility, Playa Norte is a vibrant contrast with its colorful umbrella-dotted beach with vacationers enjoying its shallow waters. Ideal for fishing, scuba diving, and snorkeling, the waters surrounding the Isla Mujeres are bustling with recreational activities. The southern tip of the island is ornamented with ruins of an old lighthouse and the temple of the Mayan Goddess. With an abundance of fresh fish, the restaurants and eateries on the Hidalgo Street, serving seafood delicacies and a variety of cuisine, are a gourmand’s paradise. A perfect destination for a beach holiday, this resort island is Mexico’s tropical gem.",

The band presents itself in its first songs with a sound that refers us to an underwater world, in a search where electronic pop coexists with instrumental passages. It currently consists of Julieta Limia on bass; Lucas Tunder on vocals, guitar and synthesizers; Luis Zunino on drums and percussion; Nicolás Aimo on synthesizers, samples and percussion; and Sebastián Ayala on guitar and backing vocals.\n\nPELS continues to present A GREEN DOG, their latest LP. The northern sextet of the conurbation is in a great and fruitful moment, having edited in the last two years, the EP “EL SOL NACIENTE”, and the LP “UN PERRO VERDE”.",
